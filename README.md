Skin Cancer Detection 📋 OverviewThis project implements a deep learning pipeline designed to assist in the early detection of skin cancer. By utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system analyzes dermatoscopic images of moles to extract visual features and identify patterns indicative of malignancy.🛠 Tech Stack & ToolsCore FrameworksPython: The primary programming language.Keras / TensorFlow: Used for building, compiling, and training the CNN models.OpenCV: Utilized for high-performance image preprocessing, including noise reduction and normalization.Development EnvironmentsGoogle Colab: Used for model training leveraging cloud GPUs.VS Code: Used for local script development, debugging, and modularizing the pipeline.📊 Dataset ReferenceThe model is trained and validated using datasets hosted on Kaggle, typically utilizing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") or the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archives.Source: Kaggle Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000Description: A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.⚙️ How It Works1. Preprocessing (OpenCV)Before the images enter the neural network, they undergo several transformations:Resizing: Scaling images to a standard input size (e.g., $224 \times 224$ pixels).Color Correction: Ensuring consistent lighting and color profiles across different camera sources.Augmentation: Applying random rotations and flips to make the model invariant to image orientation.2. CNN ArchitectureThe integrated neural network consists of:Convolutional Layers: To extract spatial features like lesion borders and asymmetry.Pooling Layers: To down-sample the data and reduce computational load.Softmax Output: To provide a probability distribution across classes (e.g., Benign vs. Malignant).🚦 Execution GuideRunning on Google ColabUpload the .ipynb notebook to your Drive.Enable GPU acceleration: Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU.Authenticate with Kaggle to download the dataset directly into the environment.Running on VS CodeClone the repository and install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.Ensure you have the Python Extension and Jupyter Extension installed.Run main.py or the provided notebook locally.📚 ReferencesKeras Documentation: https://keras.io/OpenCV-Python Tutorials: https://docs.opencv.org/Research Inspiration: Esteva, A., et al.
